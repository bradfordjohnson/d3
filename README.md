# D3.js

My notes learning JavaScript and D3.js.

Each folder contains a different project or example.

## Usage

### Basic File Serving

In order to access the data in the browser, a local server must be running.

To serve files locally with Node.js:

1. cd into the desired directory
2. Initialize a Node.js project with `npm init -y`
3. Install http-server with `npm install http-server`
4. Run the server with `npx http-server`
